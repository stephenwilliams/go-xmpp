# Go XMPP

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/stephenwilliams/go-xmpp?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/stephenwilliams/go-xmpp)

go-xmpp is a Go XMPP library, focusing on simplicity.

The goal is to make simple to write simple adhoc XMPP clients:

- For automation (like for example monitoring of an XMPP service),
- For building connected "things" by plugging them on an XMPP server,
- For writing simple chatbot to control a service or a thing.
- For writing XMPP servers components.

The library is designed to have minimal dependencies. For now, the library does not depends on any other library.
